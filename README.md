# 🛍️ E-commerce Analysis Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce dataset to extract business insights, understand customer behavior, and visualize key performance metrics using an interactive dashboard built with Python (Plotly, Dash, or Streamlit).

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

To analyze e-commerce transaction data and build an interactive dashboard that provides insights into customer trends, sales performance, and product popularity to aid in data-driven business decisions.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

* **Source:** [Sample E-commerce Dataset](#) or uploaded CSV
* **Rows:** 10,000+ transactions
* **Features:**

  * `Order ID`
  * `Customer ID`
  * `Order Date`
  * `Product`
  * `Category`
  * `Quantity`
  * `Price`
  * `Country`
  * `Payment Method`
  * `Revenue`

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

* Converted `Order Date` to datetime format
* Handled missing or inconsistent values in `Category`, `Country`, and `Payment Method`
* Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns (`Order ID`, `Customer ID`)
* Created a new column: `Total = Quantity × Price`

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Top-selling products and categories
* Revenue trends over time (monthly/yearly)
* Country-wise sales distribution
* Payment method preferences
* Average order value and quantity analysis

---
